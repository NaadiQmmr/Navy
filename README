The Navy project aims to learn us how to use the kill function, and therefore send some signals to comunicate between processes.
You have to provide a map, which is a file that contains your boats dispositions. The map needs to be configured as :

2:B1:B2
3:C1:E1
4:H1:H5

Obviously, the boats must be spaced.
The first number corresponds to the length's boat.

To start : open two tabs, for the first one run ./navy map ;
you pid will appear, and for the second one just run : ./navy map pid_player1.

Then, enter some coordinates in order to sink your opponent !


Enjoy!
