The Navy project aims to learn us how to use the kill function, and therefore send some signals to comunicate between process.
You have to provide a map, which is a file which contains your boards disposition. The map need to be configured as :

2:B1:B2
3:C1:E1
4:H1:H5

Obviously, the boards must be spaced.
The first number corresponds to the length's board.

To play : you have to open two tabs, for the first one you run ./navy map ;
you pid will appear, and for the second one you have to run : ./navy map pid_player1.

Then, enter some coordinate in order to sink your opponent !


Enjoy!
